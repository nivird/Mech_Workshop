          <h4 id="oilchanges"> Engine Oil</h4>
Engine oil is what lubricates a carâ€™s engine, allowing it to run smoothly and last longer. Car owners must maintain their carsâ€™ engines by changing the oil and using the oil appropriate for their carsâ€™ makes and models. Every car comes with a check oil light and an oil filter under the hood. These components allow car owners to monitor their oil levels and add oil as needed without having to hire a mechanic.
<h4>Changing the Oil</h4>
An important part of routine car maintenance is changing the oil regularly. The necessary frequency of oil changes has become a point of contention among experts. The Engine Oil Bible maintains that engine oil canâ€™t be changed often enough, but Nordic Group insists that, with the advent of detergent oils and multi-weight oils, some vehicles can go as far as 6,000 miles before needing an oil change. The best course of action is to check the ownerâ€™s manual and follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.
An obvious benefit of changing oneâ€™s own oil is saving money, but oil change services frequently advertise bargains. If the check engine oil light comes on when youâ€™re driving, this is a strong indication that the car is running low on oil. A driver does not need a mechanic to add oil. However, if the oil light stays on or lights up shortly after adding oil, there may be a leak, and a mechanic should look at the car.
